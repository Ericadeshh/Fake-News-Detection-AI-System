Key Observations:
Your datasets appear to be text-based (news articles), so most of the preprocessing will focus on text data

Since this is NLP, we don't need to worry much about numerical standardization or most categorical encoding

We should focus on text-specific EDA and preprocessing

‚úÖ COMPLETED DATA CLEANING STEPS:
Missing Value Handling

Filled all missing text values with empty strings

Verified no missing values remain

Text Preprocessing

Combined title + text into full_text column

Added essential text features (length, word count, etc.)

Outlier Removal

Used iterative Z-score method (threshold=3)

Guaranteed 0 outliers remain in both:

text_length

word_count

Visual confirmation via boxplots

Feature Engineering

Created numeric features (char count, word count, etc.)

Added simple sentiment indicators (!, ? counts)

Temporal features (if dates existed)

üîç VERIFICATION STEPS PERFORMED:
Missing value heatmaps

Outlier removal iterations logged

Final outlier counts confirmed as 0
