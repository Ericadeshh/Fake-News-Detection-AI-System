https://fnd-ai-sys.netlify.app/
This comprehensive fake news detection system combines advanced NLP techniques with deep learning to analyze news content through multiple input methods (text, files, URLs). The backend, built with Flask and TensorFlow/Keras, processes requests through a pipeline including content fetching, text preprocessing, LSTM-based prediction, and feedback integration. The frontend provides real-time analytics, confidence scoring, and a user feedback system that continuously improves model accuracy.
