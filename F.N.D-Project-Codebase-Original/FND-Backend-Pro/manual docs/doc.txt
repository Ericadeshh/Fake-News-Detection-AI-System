Key Observations:
Your datasets appear to be text-based (news articles), so most of the preprocessing will focus on text data

Since this is NLP, we don't need to worry much about numerical standardization or most categorical encoding

We should focus on text-specific EDA and preprocessing

‚úÖ COMPLETED DATA CLEANING STEPS:
Missing Value Handling

Filled all missing text values with empty strings

Verified no missing values remain

Text Preprocessing

Combined title + text into full_text column

Added essential text features (length, word count, etc.)

Outlier Removal

Used iterative Z-score method (threshold=3)

Guaranteed 0 outliers remain in both:

text_length

word_count

Visual confirmation via boxplots

Feature Engineering

Created numeric features (char count, word count, etc.)

Added simple sentiment indicators (!, ? counts)

Temporal features (if dates existed)

üîç VERIFICATION STEPS PERFORMED:
Missing value heatmaps

Outlier removal iterations logged

Final outlier counts confirmed as 0

# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

1.2 Install Required Packages
With your virtual environment active, install these packages:

bash
Copy
pip install flask flask-mysqldb flask-sqlalchemy flask-migrate python-dotenv
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Step 6: Setting Up the Database
6.1 Initialize the Database
First, make sure MySQL is running and you've created the database:

sql
Copy
CREATE DATABASE fnd_db;
Then run these commands in your project folder:

bash
Copy
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade

‚úÖ Backend Accomplishments
Flask API Setup - Functional endpoints for predictions and feedback

MySQL Integration - Database logging of all predictions

AI Model Integration - Your FND model is connected to the API

Migrations Configured - Database structure can evolve as needed

1. Generating Secure Secret Key
Where to generate the key:

Open a Python shell in your terminal (make sure you're in your project's virtual environment):

bash
Copy
python
Run these commands to generate and copy the key:

python
Copy
import secrets
print(secrets.token_hex(32))  # Copy the output
exit()
Paste the generated key into your .env file:

env
Copy
SECRET_KEY=the_generated_key_here  # Paste what was printed
DATABASE_URL=mysql://Ericadesh:404-found-%23@127.0.0.1/fnd_db
